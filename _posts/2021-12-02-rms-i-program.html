      <p>Ages 18 months - 3 years<br />Ratio: 1-5 with a maximum of 10
      students</p><p>The Toddler classroom offers the little ones an environment
      of self development whereby the Toddler is in an atmosphere of special
      understanding and respect. It is a program where the social, physical,
      emotional and psychological needs of each toddler are met.&nbsp;</p><p>In
      order to take full advantage of the Montessori classroom, the Toddler
      needs a self contained prepared environment. This is done where everything
      in the classroom is scaled down to the child’s level, so that they can
      independently get in and out of chairs or reach for objects. Due to this,
      the child is able to achieve some independence and does not need to rely
      on an adult to help them interact with their
      environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Toddlers are given opportunities to work in the
      development of language skills, sensorial, practical, art, and cultural.
      In the practical life area, the toddler is learning to develop skills of
      caring for themselves and their environment. Practical life activities are
      real life situations whereby the children learn dressing and undressing,
      grace and courtesy, caring for their environment and toilet training.
      Since these are real activities, each child takes great pleasure in
      accomplishing their goal.</p><p>We also focus on extra curricular
      activities such as music, dance and yoga. Our gym and outdoor space serves
      the children well in developing their gross motor skills by jumping,
      running and playing with balls.&nbsp;</p><p>The toddler room offers the
      children freedom within limits. The guidelines are set and enforced, but
      the child is able to move freely within them.</p>
