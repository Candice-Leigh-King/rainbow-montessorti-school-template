      <p>Ages 3 - 6 years</p><p>Ratio: 1-8 with a maximum of 16</p><p>The
      Montessori Casa program provides a prepared environment for the children.
      The materials used in the classroom are based on the pedagogy developed by
      Dr. Maria Montessori, and help the child in the learning process.
      Spontaneous and self-directed learning is fostered in this non-competitive
      environment. Children are free to work independently or in groups with
      their peers, gaining important social skills. Self-esteem and confident
      develop as children explore with the materials and master important
      developmental skills. There are 5 different areas of the Montessori
      Curriculum in the Casa Program.</p><p>Practical Life</p><p>Practical Life
      exercises are the most important part of the Montessori classroom. These
      activities offer children the ability to master everyday living
      experiences. They lay the foundation for sequential thinking,
      concentration, coordination, abstract understanding, and self-confidence.
      The children are drawn to and delighted by detailed exercises that offer
      them the ability to control their environment, and achieve the
      independence they need to function in the world around
      them.</p><p>Sensorial&nbsp;</p><p>Sensorial activities help the child make
      sense of the impressions they perceive from the world around them. These
      specifically designed materials define weight, size, shape, colour, sound,
      smell and texture. With an awareness of these concepts, the child develops
      clear and detailed vocabulary guided by their
      teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>Mathematic</p><p>The Mathematics materials provide a
      concrete understanding of number concepts and operations. The materials
      allow the child to explore the two aspects of a number - quantity and
      symbol. There are opportunities for further discovery of the Decimal
      system, and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and
      division. This hands-on approach to mathematics allows the child to
      experience, rather than memorize. The children work through exercises that
      lead to a more abstract understanding of mathematical operations,
      terminology and concepts.</p><p>Language</p><p>Children are introduced to
      the phonetic sounds of the letters, which gives them the tools they need
      to understand written language. Tracing letter shapes made of sand paper
      and working with metal insets prepare children for the mechanical part of
      the writing. The language materials introduce the phonetic sounds of each
      letter in the alphabet. Using these sounds the child is able to build
      words, thus begins the process of reading. Along with preparatory
      exercises in Practical Life and Sensorial Education, language materials
      also foster muscle control for printing. When ready, children are
      encouraged to create stories that demonstrate the expressive part of
      writing. Students begin reading during this stage of development, and
      proceed at their own pace. Grammar and different parts of speech are
      taught with concrete examples that keep the children more engaged with the
      concepts.&nbsp;</p><p>Cultural</p><p>Cultural activities open the child’s
      eyes to the dynamic and diverse world around them. These materials include
      the subjects of Geography, History, Zoology, Botany, and Science. Children
      really enjoy learning about different cultures and traditions, tasting
      food from different countries, learning their songs, dances and more.
      Activities such as music, art, physical education and field trips are
      included as part of the curriculum.</p>
