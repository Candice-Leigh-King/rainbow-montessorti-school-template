      <h3>An epic van for your adventure</h3><h2>The Underground
      Vans</h2><p>Ages: 6 months-18 months<br />Ratio: 1-3 with a maximum of 10
      students</p><p>“Is there anything more precious and more vulnerable than a
      newborn…More deserving of a family’s love and society’s care?” ~ Newsweek
      Special Edition on Infants Spring/Summer 1997</p><p>Like all our other
      programs, Rainbow Montessori School’s Infant program is specifically
      designed for those parents who demand and expect the best Montessori
      Environment in which their child will grow and learned during the most
      sensitive period of their life.&nbsp;</p><p>Maria Montessori identified
      children’s “sensitive periods.” She applied this term to a child’s ability
      to absorb knowledge rapidly if the opportunity is provided. The “sensitive
      periods” for infants are: movement, order, and language.</p><p>Given a
      loving, nurturing environment, infants learn faster than at any other time
      in their lives. Montessori believed that infants not only have the ability
      to absorb knowledge but also the capability to teach
      themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>The infant’s needs are paradoxical, characterized
      by a bonded relationship between adult and child versus a growing sense of
      self and independence. The infant environment is characterized by order,
      simplicity, and beauty, which meets the needs of the child.</p><p>The
      Rainbow Montessori Infant room focuses on fostering trust in the child.
      The environment centers on the children as well as the adults, whose
      caring, respectful response to the infants needs conveys the message of
      love, caring and acceptance.</p>
