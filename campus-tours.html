          <p><strong><u>1. Does the school operate
          year-round?</u></strong></p><p>Yes! Rainbow Montessori offers a
          full-year program, with our core academic year running from September
          to June, followed by an engaging summer program from July through
          August. This allows families the option of consistent, year-round care
          and learning.</p><p>Our school hours are<strong> 8:00 AM to 5:00
          PM</strong>, Monday through Friday. Each program's tuition covers the
          above-mentioned 9 hour days, however we also offer an <strong>extended
          care</strong> option from <strong>7:30 AM –5:30 PM</strong> for an
          additional fee, providing flexibility for families who need extra
          support outside of regular hours!</p><h6></h6>

          <p><strong><u>2. How long has the business been operating?<br
          /></u></strong><br />Rainbow Montessori School has been proudly
          serving the Ottawa community for over 26 years under the continuous
          ownership of Shereen Gendron. What began as a small in-home
          Montessori—started by Shereen as a mother herself—has grown into two
          locally owned and operated locations. Shereen remains actively
          involved to this day, and the school continues to reflect the same
          hands-on, family-first values it was founded on. We take pride in
          offering a warm, personalized environment rooted in care, trust, and
          community.</p>

          <p><strong><u>3. How can I tell if a school is truly Montessori
          certified?<br /></u></strong><br />The term <strong>"Montessori"
          </strong>is not legally protected, meaning any school can use it and
          claim to be Montessori, regardless of adherence to authentic
          Montessori principles.</p><p>Rainbow Montessori School is an
          <strong>authentic Montessori school</strong> led by MACTE accredited
          trained teachers, certified materials, and a philosophy rooted in
          independence, self-directed learning, and respect for the child. Our
          schools also follow <strong>Ontario Ministry of Education
          standards</strong>, while also offering enriched learning that often
          helps children progress well beyond age-level
          expectations—academically, socially, and emotionally.</p><p>To
          identify a genuine Montessori school, parents should look
          for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Certified Montessori educators (e.g., AMI,
          MACTE)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Montessori-specific
          materials</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Mixed-age classrooms and
          smaller, more personalized class sizes with low student to teacher
          ratio</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A calm, structured, child-led
          environment</strong></p></li></ul><p>We encourage families to ask
          questions and observe classrooms when choosing a Montessori
          program.</p>

          <p><strong><u>4. Who is Montessori for?<br /></u></strong><br />Our
          program is best suited for those who are seeking a dedicated
          <strong>Montessori-based education and philosophy</strong>, and who
          value a long-term, child-centered approach to learning—which
          ultimately benefits their child’s educational
          journey.</p><p>Montessori is especially beneficial for children who
          thrive in:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Structured
          independence</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Hands-on, self-paced
          learning</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Calm, focused
          environments</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Smaller, more
          personalized class sizes with low student to teacher ratio
          </strong>-<strong> </strong>allows us to truly support each child’s
          individual journey and build the foundation for a lifetime of
          confident, engaged learning.</p></li></ul><p>This approach nurtures
          confidence, curiosity, and concentration—skills that lay a strong
          foundation for enriched lifelong learning and often helps children
          progress well beyond age-level expectations—academically, socially,
          and emotionally.</p>

          <p><strong><u>5. Is Rainbow Montessori School part of the Canada-Wide
          Early Learning and Child Care reduced fee government program?<br
          /></u></strong><br />While we have opted into the program, Rainbow
          Montessori is <strong>not </strong>part of the CWELCC program.<strong>
          </strong>The reason for this is that the CWELCC program is currently
          at capacity due to limited government funding, and we are not eligible
          to participate until further funding is allocated. Once additional
          government funding becomes available again and our opt in application
          is accepted, we will update this section accordingly!</p>

          <p><strong><u>6. Do you offer a subsidized program?<br
          /></u></strong><br />No, Rainbow Montessori does not offer a
          subsidized program. As a specialized private school offering an
          enriched Montessori education with a unique, hands-on approach to
          early learning, our fees are set independently and are not covered by
          publicly funded subsidy models.</p>
