          <h6>1. Does the school operate year-round?</h6><p><br />Yes! Rainbow
          Montessori offers a full-year program, with our core academic year
          running from September to June, followed by an engaging summer program
          from July through August. This allows families the option of
          consistent, year-round care and learning.</p>

          <h6><strong>2. What are your hours of operation?</strong></h6><p><br
          />Our school hours are<strong> 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM</strong>, Monday
          through Friday. Each program's tuition covers the above-mentioned 9
          hour days, however we also offer an <strong>extended care</strong>
          option from <strong>7:30 AM –5:30 PM</strong> for an additional fee,
          providing flexibility for families who need extra support outside of
          regular hours!</p><h6></h6>

          <h6><strong>3. How long has the business been
          operating?</strong></h6><p><br />Rainbow Montessori School has been
          proudly serving the Ottawa community for over 26 years under the
          continuous ownership of Shereen Gendron. What began as a small in-home
          Montessori—started by Shereen as a mother herself—has grown into two
          locally owned and operated locations. Shereen remains actively
          involved to this day, and the school continues to reflect the same
          hands-on, family-first values it was founded on. We take pride in
          offering a warm, personalized environment rooted in care, trust, and
          community.</p>

          <h6><strong>4. How can I tell if a school is truly Montessori
          certified?</strong></h6><p><br />The term <strong>"Montessori"
          </strong>is not legally protected, meaning any school can use it and
          claim to be Montessori, regardless of adherence to authentic
          Montessori principles.</p><p>Rainbow Montessori School is an
          <strong>authentic Montessori school</strong> led by MACTE accredited
          trained teachers, certified materials, and a philosophy rooted in
          independence, self-directed learning, and respect for the child. Our
          schools also follow <strong>Ontario Ministry of Education
          standards</strong>, while also offering enriched learning that often
          helps children progress well beyond age-level
          expectations—academically, socially, and emotionally.</p><p>To
          identify a genuine Montessori school, parents should look
          for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Certified Montessori educators (e.g., AMI,
          MACTE)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Montessori-specific
          materials</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Mixed-age classrooms and
          smaller, more personalized class sizes with low student to teacher
          ratio</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>A calm, structured, child-led
          environment</strong></p></li></ul><p>We encourage families to ask
          questions and observe classrooms when choosing a Montessori
          program.</p><h6></h6>

          <h6><strong>5. Who is Montessori for?</strong></h6><p><br />Our
          program is best suited for those who are seeking a dedicated
          <strong>Montessori-based education and philosophy</strong>, and who
          value a long-term, child-centered approach to learning—which
          ultimately benefits their child’s educational
          journey.</p><p>Montessori is especially beneficial for children who
          thrive in:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Structured
          independence</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Hands-on, self-paced
          learning</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Calm, focused
          environments</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Smaller, more
          personalized class sizes with low student to teacher ratio
          </strong>-<strong> </strong>allows us to truly support each child’s
          individual journey and build the foundation for a lifetime of
          confident, engaged learning.</p></li></ul><p>This approach nurtures
          confidence, curiosity, and concentration—skills that lay a strong
          foundation for enriched lifelong learning and often helps children
          progress well beyond age-level expectations—academically, socially,
          and emotionally.</p>

          <h6><strong>6. Is Rainbow Montessori School part of the Canada-Wide
          Early Learning and Child Care reduced fee government
          program?</strong></h6><p><br />While we have opted into the program,
          Rainbow Montessori is <strong>not </strong>part of the CWELCC
          program.<strong> </strong>The reason for this is that the CWELCC
          program is currently at capacity due to limited government funding,
          and we are not eligible to participate until further funding is
          allocated. Once additional government funding becomes available again
          and our opt in application is accepted, we will update this section
          accordingly!</p>

          <h6><strong>7. Do you offer a subsidized program?</strong></h6><p><br
          />No, Rainbow Montessori does not offer a subsidized program. As a
          specialized private school offering an enriched Montessori education
          with a unique, hands-on approach to early learning, our fees are set
          independently and are not covered by publicly funded subsidy
          models.</p>
