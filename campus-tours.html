          <p><strong><u>1. Do both schools operate year-round? What are your
          hours of operation?</u></strong></p><p>Yes! Rainbow Montessori offers
          a full-year program, with our core academic year running from
          September to June, followed by an engaging summer program from July
          through August. This allows families the option of consistent,
          year-round care and learning.</p><p>Our school hours are<strong> 8:00
          AM to 5:00 PM</strong>, Monday through Friday. Each program's tuition
          covers the above-mentioned 9 hour days, however we also offer an
          <strong>extended care</strong> option from <strong>7:30 AM –5:30
          PM</strong> for an additional fee, providing flexibility for families
          who need extra support outside of regular hours!</p><h6></h6>

          <p><strong><u>2. How long has the business been operating? Is there a
          difference in the two locations?<br /></u></strong><br />Rainbow
          Montessori School has been proudly serving the Ottawa community for
          over 26 years under the continuous ownership of Shereen Gendron. What
          began as a small in-home Montessori—started by Shereen as a mother
          herself—has grown into two locally owned and operated locations.
          Shereen remains actively involved to this day, and the school
          continues to reflect the same hands-on, family-first values it was
          founded on.</p><p>While our community has grown, our commitment to
          quality has remained the same. Both locations offer the same nurturing
          environment, trained staff, and authentic Montessori experience. The
          only difference is geographic—families simply choose the location that
          is most convenient for them. We take pride in offering a warm,
          personalized atmosphere rooted in care, trust, and community.</p>

          <p><strong><u>3. How can I tell if a school is truly Montessori
          certified?<br /></u></strong><br />The term <strong>"Montessori"
          </strong>is not legally protected, meaning any school can use it and
          claim to be Montessori, regardless of adherence to authentic
          Montessori principles.</p><p>Rainbow Montessori School is an
          <strong>authentic Montessori school</strong> led by MACTE accredited
          trained teachers, certified materials, and a philosophy rooted in
          independence, self-directed learning, and respect for the child. Our
          schools also follow <strong>Ontario Ministry of Education
          standards</strong>, while also offering enriched learning that often
          helps children progress well beyond age-level
          expectations—academically, socially, and emotionally.</p><p>To
          identify a genuine Montessori school, parents should look
          for:</p><p><strong>- Certified Montessori educators (e.g., AMI,
          MACTE)<br />- Montessori-specific materials<br />- Mixed-age
          classrooms and smaller, more personalized class sizes with low student
          to teacher ratio<br />- A calm, structured, child-led
          environment</strong></p><p>We encourage families to ask questions and
          observe classrooms when choosing a Montessori program.</p>

          <p class="center"><strong><u>4. Who is Montessori learning for? What
          are the benefits?<br /></u></strong><br />Our program is best suited
          for those who are seeking a dedicated <strong>Montessori-based
          education and philosophy</strong>, and who value a long-term,
          child-centered approach to learning—which ultimately benefits their
          child’s educational journey.</p><p class="center">Montessori is
          especially beneficial for children who thrive in:</p><p>- Structured
          Independence<br />- Hands-on, self-paced learning<br />- Calm, focused
          environments<br />- Smaller, more personalized class sizes with low
          student to teacher ratio, which allows us to truly support each
          child's individual journey and build the foundation for a lifetime of
          confident, engaged learning.</p><p class="center">This approach
          nurtures confidence, curiosity, and concentration—skills that lay a
          strong foundation for enriched lifelong learning and often helps
          children progress well beyond age-level expectations—academically,
          socially, and emotionally.</p>

          <p><strong><u>5. Is Rainbow Montessori School part of the Canada-Wide
          Early Learning and Child Care reduced fee government program?<br
          /></u></strong><br />While we have opted into the program, Rainbow
          Montessori is <strong>not </strong>part of the CWELCC program.<strong>
          </strong>The reason for this is that the CWELCC program is currently
          at capacity due to limited government funding, and we are not eligible
          to participate until further funding is allocated. Once additional
          government funding becomes available again and our opt in application
          is accepted, we will update this section accordingly!</p>

          <p><strong><u>6. Do you offer a subsidized program?<br
          /></u></strong><br />No, Rainbow Montessori does not offer a
          subsidized program. As a specialized private school offering an
          enriched Montessori education with a unique, hands-on approach to
          early learning, our fees are set independently and are not covered by
          publicly funded subsidy models.</p>
