      subheading: Montessori Methods
      textarea: >-
        Montessori Education was founded in 1907 by Dr. Maria Montessori, the
        first woman in Italy to become a physician. Very early on she realized
        through observation of children that they teach themselves, and that the
        role of the teacher should be that of a guide as opposed to a lecturer.
        Based on those Observations, Montessori established “the prepared
        environment” to further enhance the children’s ability to learn. This
        environment puts great emphasis on being accessible to children, hence,
        the furniture is scaled down, the shelves are low, and all materials
        available to the children are attractive, neat and in working order. In
        this environment, the child is able to choose, at will, any material
        they desire. 



        The Montessori Classroom features five areas: Practical life, Sensorial,
        Mathematics, Language and Culture. 



        The classes see children placed in three year age groupings. These
        groups establish communities of children willing and able to share their
        knowledge with their peers. The younger classmates learn from observing
        the older ones, the older ones are put in a position of authority and
        example to the younger ones.



        The Montessori child is one who is self disciplined, always willing to
        learn, co-operative, independent and curious about life. Learning is an
        exciting, life-long process, which the Montessori child enjoys to the
        fullest.

        a year there was a waiting list of 12 children and expansion was
        necessary. In 2001, the school moved to accommodate 12 children, then 35
        children, until the school grew to reach 125 students in 2011. Currently
        we have two locations which together can accommodate 62 children.
