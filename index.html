      subheading: Montessori Methods
      textarea: >-
        Montessori Education was founded in 1907 by Dr. Maria Montessori, who
        discovered that children teach themselves, and thus the role of the
        teacher should be that of a guide as opposed to a lecturer. Montessori
        established “the prepared environment” to further enhance the children’s
        ability to learn. This environment puts great emphasis on being
        accessible to children.

        The Montessori Classroom features five areas: Practical life, Sensorial,
        Mathematics, Language and Culture. The classes see children placed in
        three year age groupings which establishes communities of children
        willing and able to share their knowledge with their peers. The younger
        classmates learn from observing the older ones, the older ones are put
        in a position of authority and example to the younger ones. The
        Montessori child is one who is self disciplined, always willing to
        learn, co-operative, independent and curious about life. Learning is an
        exciting, life-long process, which the Montessori child enjoys to the
        fullest.

          <p>Sending our son to Rainbow Montessori is one of the best decisions
          that we have made as parents. Our son has been with Rainbow Montessori
          since 15 months old and he has enjoyed every day there. All teachers
          are passionate and truly care for the students. Our son has benefited
          a lot in terms of independence and knowledge from the Montessori
          program as well. We definitely recommend Rainbow Montessori
          School.</p>

          <p>All 3 of our children went through the amazing Rainbow Montessori
          Program and each one has thrived. They looked forward to school
          everyday, and still to this day ask about RMS! Rainbow Montessori made
          sure that all of our children were more than equipped with the skills
          needed to succeed in grade school. We are forever thankful!</p>

          <p>The Montessori style of learning has put our children at an
          advantage for future learning. We are blown away by the level of
          knowledge and confidence our children have gained from RMS. We love
          the communication, professionalism and kindness of the Rainbow
          Montessori staff and we are forever grateful to have had the
          opportunity of enrolling our children here.</p>
